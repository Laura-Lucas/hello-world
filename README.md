I'm Laura and I love my family, learning, building, designing, everything outdoors, wildlife, photography, the awesome VW community, researching, technology, helping others, traveling and food.
My favorite roadtrip was traveling from Knoxville, TN to Cannon Beach, Oregon with my daughter in the summer of 2015. We went through the east side of Yellow Stone National Park and camped every night for the three weeks that we were gone. It was an amazing experience!
I love skydiving!
I flew a Cessna 180 once and would like to get my pilot license and maybe own a small plane when I retire.
I love looking at the stars and the photographing the moon.
I love watching meteor showers.
I love coffee and my 1969 VW Bus :)
